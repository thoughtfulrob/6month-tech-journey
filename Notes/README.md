# Notes – Reference & Cheat Sheets

This folder is for reusable knowledge, not day-by-day logs.

## Planned Notes

- `Linux.md` – Commands, filesystem layout, services, logs.
- `Networking.md` – IPs, subnets, ports, DNS, DHCP, routing basics.
- `Windows.md` – Event Viewer, services, permissions, useful tools.
- `Security.md` – CIA triad, auth vs authz, common attacks, defenses.
- `Python.md` – Snippets for file parsing, HTTP requests, APIs, etc.
- `Troubleshooting.md` – Patterns and checklists for debugging issues.

As I progress through the 6-month plan, I’ll update these files with summaries, examples, and commands I want to remember.
